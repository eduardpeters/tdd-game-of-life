# TDD-game-of-life

This repository holds the console app that implements Conway's Game of Life, the final exercise of the Test-Driven Development course at the University of Helsinki. It was, to the best of my skill, developed following the TDD cycle.

### Features
- Takes a path to an [RLE](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Run_Length_Encoded) file as first argument
- Takes the number of generations to simulate as second argument
- Prints to `STDOUT` with the updated generation's RLE file
